### Hello! I am Sera Bostan 👋

I am currently working at Yaya Labs where we're developing a humanoid robot called Desdemona 🤖, or we call her Desi, that is powered by AI for leveraging creativity in the entertainment sector! Desi is a going to be a popstar touring the world, and making collaborations with musical atrists to expand the music insdustry and push the unseen boundaries ✨


As part of my postgrad journey in Neurotechnolgy stream, I have started using Pyhton, and have worked with some of my classmates to decode neural activity of a monkey using ✨Deep Learning✨! I also did some Reinforcement Learning projects previously as part of my module :)

During my undergrad, MATLAB was the main programme I have used to complete statistical analysis 📊 and for EEG feature extraction/classification projects 🧠.
Recently,  I have used it for investigating how humans adapt to horizontal arm movements in an unknown field (pretty cool☺). 🦾

### What I'm focusing on now: 🧘‍♀️
I am searching for interesting voice synthesis repos to check out and maybe implement for Desi to develop a unique singing voice!
In the meantime, I am taking an online course on Coursera on Neural Networks and Deep Learning provided by DeepLearning.ai. Learning very cool stuff :)
### My Goal is 🏆
to spend more time to start new projects and improve my coding through interesting projects :)
